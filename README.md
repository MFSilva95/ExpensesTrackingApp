### Tips

- Run `composer install` & `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` if you want to build assets for development
- Run `npm run build` if you want to build assets for productions
- Run `npm run watch` if you want to build assets during development & have it automatically be watched so that it rebuilds after you make updates to front-end
- Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to rebuild docker containers if you are using docker to make sure you are using the same versions as the videos
